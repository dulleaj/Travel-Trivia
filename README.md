Challenge 3: Methods Within A Custom Class, App Architecture (MVC)

App Description:

Ask multiple choice trivia questions about different countries in the world.

Concepts Learned:

Understanding when and how to use a custom class, how to use different methods and properties within a custom class, how to use MVC to keep your app efficient and clean


My Struggles:

The hardest part of this app was referencing the last question added to an NSMutable Array. I added a 'Help' button the user can click on to show them the last question they answered incorrectly, which I struggled with because I didn't fully understand how NSMutable arrays worked. This was also my first time using a customer class - learning how to use objects from customer classes to reference methods from that class was difficult. This app was a great introduction to both subjects.
